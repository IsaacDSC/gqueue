# Contributing to IWebhook

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this webhook system as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.23.7 or higher
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For running dependencies (Redis, MongoDB)
- **Make**: For using the Makefile commands
- **Git**: For version control

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gqueue.git
   cd gqueue
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Start Dependencies with Docker**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d redis mongodb
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   # Start all services (webhook API + worker)
   make run-all
   
   # Or start services separately
   make run-webhook  # API only
   make run-worker   # Worker only
   ```

### Available Make Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build` | Build the application binary |
| `make run-all` | Start both webhook API and worker services |
| `make run-webhook` | Start only the webhook API service |
| `make run-worker` | Start only the worker service |
| `make test` | Run all tests |
| `make load-test` | Execute load testing |
| `make clean` | Clean generated binaries |

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Directory Structure

- `cmd/` - Application entry points
  - `api/` - Main application server
  - `loadtest/` - Load testing utilities
  - `setup/` - Setup utilities (HTTP server, middleware, worker)
- `internal/` - Private application code
  - `backoffice/` - Consumer registration logic
  - `cfg/` - Configuration management
  - `domain/` - Domain models and business logic
  - `eventqueue/` - Event processing and queue handling
  - `interstore/` - Data storage interfaces
- `pkg/` - Public packages that can be imported
  - `asynqsvc/` - Async queue service utilities
  - `cache/` - Caching layer
  - `httpsvc/` - HTTP service utilities
  - `logs/` - Logging utilities
- `example/` - Example implementations
- `docs/` - Documentation and assets

### Key Components

- **Event Queue**: Handles event processing using Asynq
- **HTTP API**: REST API for webhook management
- **Worker**: Background job processor
- **Cache**: Redis-based caching strategy
- **Storage**: MongoDB for data persistence

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests for specific package
go test -v ./internal/eventqueue

# Run tests with coverage
go test -v -cover ./...
```

### Test Structure

- Unit tests are located alongside the source code with `_test.go` suffix
- Integration tests use testcontainers for external dependencies
- Load tests are available in `cmd/loadtest/`

### Writing Tests

- Follow Go testing conventions
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies using the provided mock interfaces
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## üìù Code Style and Guidelines

### Go Code Standards

- Follow [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `go fmt` to format your code
- Use `go vet` to check for common errors
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Write clear, descriptive comments for exported functions and types

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use interfaces to define contracts
- Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Follow the Clean Architecture principles evident in the project structure

### Error Handling

- Use Go's idiomatic error handling
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf`
- Define custom error types in the `domain` package when appropriate
- Log errors at appropriate levels
